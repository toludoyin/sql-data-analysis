## 📚 Business Task
In this session I assisted Danny to answer a few question about his customers, such as their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. These answers will help Danny to have a deeper connection with his customers and deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program.
